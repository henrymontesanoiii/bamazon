## Customer Usage
### As a customer, you are able to view items available for sale as well as their price. You can pick an item & item quantity to purchase. If there is available stock, the purchase will go through, telling the customer the amount of money they owe and ask them if they would like to make another purchase. If there is not enough stock, the customer will not be able to purchase that item and will be asked to make another purchase.
